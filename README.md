Of course you can create your own employers and _members_ if you'd like.

Admin can:
* Create employers

Employer can:
* Create dogs
* Remove dogs
* Edit dogs

Everyone can:
* Look at adopted dogs
* Look at dogs searching for home
* Take a quiz
* Make an account (although it doesn't let you do anything new)

How does the quiz work?
> It will always give you at least one dog, unless there are no dogs searching for home. It searches for dogs matching the most of your needs.
